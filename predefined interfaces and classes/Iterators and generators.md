# Iterators and generators

Iterator extends Traversable, Generator implements Iterator. 

Traversable doesn't do much on its own. It is just an abstract base interface that detects if a class is traversable with foreach. As such, it is extended by Iterator (and also IteratorAggregator).

## Iterator

```php
Iterator extends Traversable {
    /* Methods */
    abstract public mixed current ( void )
    abstract public scalar key ( void )
    abstract public void next ( void )
    abstract public void rewind ( void )
    abstract public bool valid ( void )
}
```

In practice, it would be rare I think to use the native iterator interface. You would more likely find a suitable SPL iterator as your starting point, e.g. DirectoryIterator for reading from the filesystem. Having said that, a good and commonly used example for explaining the use of iterators is reading from the filesystem.

The naÃ¯ve way of reading from the file system would be something like this (based on example at https://www.entropywins.wtf/blog/2017/10/16/introduction-to-iterators-and-generators-in-php/):

```php
function getContentsOfTextFiles(): array {
    $path = './texts/';
    $texts = [];
    foreach(glob($path . '*.txt') as $textFile) {
        $texts[] = file_get_contents($textFile);
    }
    return $texts;
}

function findTextWithString(array $texts) {
    foreach ($texts as $key=>$text) {
        if(strpos($text, 'foo') !== false){
            return $key;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

function findString() {
    return findTextWithString(getContentsOfTextFiles());
}

echo findString();
```

This will return the position in the texts folder of the first file containing 'foo'.
