# php_cert_study
Using GitHub to manage and store study notes created/edited locally as markdown, using [Typora editor](https://typora.io/).

Currently working my way through 'PHP 7 Zend Certification Study Guide' by Andrew Beak as a way of revising, filling in gaps and strengthening areas of weakness in my PHP knowledge. These notes generally relate to specific questions in the book.
