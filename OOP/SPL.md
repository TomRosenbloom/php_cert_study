# SPL

> The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems. 

This was originally an a third party library but has now been incorporated into the core of PHP (as of version 5.0.0).

## Iterators

SPL provides a bunch of task-specific iterators based on the PHP Iterator interface.
