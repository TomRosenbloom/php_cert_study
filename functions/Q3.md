Question 3

T/F 'You cannot use empty() as a callback for the usort() function'

Not sure what they are getting at here... why would you even consider doing this?

usort is the function that allows you to sort an array using a user-defined comparison function. 

empty() is the function used to discern if a variable is 'empty' (empty string, string containing just 0, integer 0, float 0.0, empty array, FALSE, NULL). It returns TRUE or FALSE.

So empty() is neither user-defined or a comparison function....
