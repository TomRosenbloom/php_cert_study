## Spaceship operator

Spaceship operator is \<=\> and it test the relative size of two operands. (Not to be confused with the not equal operator \<\>).

  Operation   Value
----------- -------
  1 \<=\> 0   1
  1 \<=\> 1   0
  1 \<=\> 2   -1

So largest on left, positive, largest on right, negative.

This can also be used to compare strings, but there is some catch related to first letter capitalisation. More on this later.
