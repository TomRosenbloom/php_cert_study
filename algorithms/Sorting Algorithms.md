# Sorting Algorithms

Description and comparison of the more well known sorting algorithms.

## Comparison sorting

When you think about sorting things, it seems obvious that this must involve comparing them with each other - 'is this thing bigger of smaller than this other thing?' In fact there are some sorting methods that *don't* use comparison, but I'll get to those later.

### Bubble sort

Bubble sort is very easy to understand, but is also [famously inefficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8). 

```
    A is the (zero-indexed) array to be sorted
    n is the number of elements in A

    for i = 1 to n
        j = i
        while A[j] > A[j-1] and j > 0
            swap A[j] and A[j-1]
            j = j-1
```

The basic idea is



### Selection sort



### Insertion sort

### Merge sort
